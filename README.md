# Test-Driven Development
## Sebastian Bergmann and Stefan Priebsch

> Writing good code with automated tests does pay off, even more on the long run, when major changes to your software become necessary. In this workshop, we will introduce you to Test-Driven Development as it was meant to be. You will not only understand how TDD fundamentally challenges how you have thought about software to this day, but also experience the joy of the red-green-refactor cycle. Join Sebastian and Stefan on a journey that might forever change the way you think about code. And tests, for that matter. Make sure to bring your own laptop with a current PHP and PHPUnit version, there will be plenty of room for you to work on exercises while being individually coached by the trainers.
